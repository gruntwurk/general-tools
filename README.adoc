The GruntWurk `general-tools` repository is a collection of various tools to help with software development --
particularly in the area of automating the setup of development environments and servers --
on virtual machines and/or on Raspberry Pi's.

== Contents

Here is what each subfolder in this collection is for:

* *develop_via_vagrant* -- Automation for setting up a Python (or other) development environment "`back-end`" as a pre-configured virtual machine. This allows every developer to consistently compile, test, debug, and deploy code using the exact same compiler/interpreter with the exact same dependencies -- yet the "`front-end`" can be completely different (e.g. one developer using the VS Code IDE on a Windows machine, while another is using PyCharm on a Mac).
* *raspberry_pi* -- Automation for setting up a Raspberry Pi machine (e.g. as Network Attached Storage server, or as a web server, etc.)
* *scripts_library* -- Linux BASH scripts (and corresponding helper functions) common to `develop_via_vagrant` and `raspberry_pi`.
* *reference_library* -- Misc. developer notes (cheat sheets).
* *doc* -- Documentation for the above.


== Documentation

=== Python Development

* link:/doc/DEVELOP_VIA_VAGRANT.adoc[Using Vagrant to manage a virtual machine development environment back-end.]
* link:/doc/VISUAL_STUDIO_CODE.adoc[Using the Visual Studio Code IDE as the front-end to accomplish remote development/debugging with the Vagrant back-end].
* link:/doc/PYTHON_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENTS.adoc[Some notes on isolating your Python project's dependencies via VENV.] No matter whether you are developing via Vagrant or not.



=== Raspberry Pi Setup Scripts

To set up a Raspberry Pi box to be a server, it depends on which model of Pi is being used.

* link:/doc/Pi_4B_OS_Install.adoc[Raspberry Pi Model 4B.]
* link:/doc/Pi_3B_OS_Install.adoc[Raspberry Pi Model 3B (or earlier).]



=== The Scripts Library

Once you have Linux installed (on a Raspberry Pi, in a virtual machine, or any other type of box), you can take advantage of the following scripts to further configure the box.
Note: These scripts all assume that it's a Debian-based distribution of Linux (which uses the APT package manager).

* `basics_debian.sh` -- Slightly elevates a bare-minimum Debian install to a higher baseline. (Used by the Raspberry Pi Model 4B instructions, above.)
* `helper_functions_debian.sh` -- Common BASH functions that all of the other scripts rely on (logging, APT packages, editing config files, etc.)
* `heighten_security_debian.sh` -- Be sure to run this for any server that will be accessible from the Internet.
* `install_simple_nas_debian.sh` -- Creates a simple file-sharing NAS, with options for installing SAMBA, NFS, video streaming, and music streaming.
* `install_webserver_debian.sh` -- Install an Apache2 web server with MySQL (MariaDB, actually) and PHP.
* `install_jukebox_server.sh` -- Sets up a dedicated music streaming server (for when it's not on the same box as the simple NAS).
* `install_jukebox_client.sh` -- (Work in progress). Installs a bare-bones command-line client for music streaming. For example, use it to test the server.
* `install_nextcloud.sh` -- (Work in progress) Setting up a personal cloud (i.e. more sophisticated than a simple NAS).

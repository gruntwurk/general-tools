=== Here Documents (multi-line string constants)
Generally,

    mycommand-that-takes-stdin <<SomeUniqueString
    foo
    bar
    baz
    SomeUniqueString

Most often, EOF is uses as the unique string (unless EOF appears within the body).

There is a variant with a hyphen `<<-SomeUniqueString` that tells bash to ignore leading \t's (but not leading spaces).

To load the text into a bash variable...

    read -d '' myvariable <<EOF ...

== Logic

=== Flow Control

    if [ ... ]; then
        ...
    elif [ ... ]; then
        ...
    else
        ...
    fi


    source include-file


=== General Comparison Operators

(See also the comparison operators under <<numbers,Numbers>>, <<strings,Strings>>, <<files,Files>>, and <<dates,Dates>>, below.)

[width="100%"]
|===
| if [ -v varname ] | varname defined (unary) 
|===


=== Functions

    log() {
        echo $* &>> /vagrant/bootstrap.log
    }

[width="100%"]
|===
|$1 .. $n | single argument
|$*       | all arguments
|$@       | all arguments
|"$*"     | all arguments as a single string ("foo bar baz")
|"$@"     | all arguments as separate strings ("foo" "bar" "baz")
|===



[[in-line]]
== In-Line Processing

=== String Delimiters

Double quotes -- contents are processed
Single quotes -- contents are NOT processed

Processing includes
* dollar-sign expansion
* back-slash escaping

=== Command Substitution

Original way: 
	back-tics \`...\` -- backslashes are literals, not escapes

Alternative way: 
	$(...) -- backslashes are escapes

=== Arithmetic

	$((...)) -- double parens

Note: Division truncates to integer values

=== Parameter Expansion

[width="100%"]
|===
| `${param:-foo}`                | uses foo as *default* if param is undefined/null
| `${param:=foo}`                | same, but also sets param to that value
| `${param:offset}`              | *substring (0-based)* to EOL
| `${param:offset:len}`          | substring (0-based) for length
| `${param: -offset}`            | substring starting at offset from EOL
| `${param: -offset:len}`        | substring starting at offset from EOL for len
| `${:#param}`                   | *length* of param's string value
| `${:#*}`                       | *number of arguments*
| `${param/pattern/substitute}`  | replaces first match (greedy)
| `${param//pattern/substitute}` | *replaces all matches*
| `${param/#pattern/substitute}` | replaces only a starts-with match
| `${param/%pattern/substitute}` | replaces only an ends-with match
| `${param#pattern}`             | delete a starts-with match
| `${param##pattern}`            | delete a starts-with match (greedy)
| `${param%pattern}`             | delete an ends-with match
| `${param%%pattern}`            | delete an ends-with match (greedy)
| `${param@U}` or `${param^^}`   | uppercase all letters
| `${param@u}` or `${param^}`    | capitalize first letter only
| `${param@L}` or `${param,,}`   | lowercase all letters
| `${param,}`                    | lowercase first letter only
| `${param@Q}`                   | quoted (if not already)
| `${param@E}`                   | escape characters expanded
| `${param@P}`                   | expanded as a prompt format string
| `${param@A}`                   | expanded as an assignment statement
| `${param@a}`                   | returns the attributes of param
|===

Note: Using /pattern without specifying a /substitute is equivalent to using ##pattern.

Note: This short list doesn't even begin to cover all of the variations involving arrays.

Pattern matching is an odd blend of GLOB and REGEX:

[width="100%"]
|===
| ?               | any one character    
| *               | 0 or more characters 
| [...]           | character list     
| [:class:]       | alnum, alpha, ascii, blank, cntrl, digit, graph, lower, print, punct, space, upper, word, xdigit 
| ?(pattern-list) | up to one occurrences of the pattern(s)
| *(pattern-list) | zero or more occurrences
| +(pattern-list) | one or more occurrences
| @(pattern-list) | exactly one occurrence 
| !(pattern-list) | all-but the first occurrence 
|===

pattern-list is one or more patterns separated by vertical bars.



[[numbers]]
== Numbers

=== Numeric Comparison Operators

[width="100%"]
|===
| -eq, -ne   | equality
| -lt, -gt   | less/greater
| -le, -ge   | or equals
|===



[[strings]]
== Strings/Text

=== String Comparison Operators

[width="100%"]
|===
| ==, !=     | equality
| <, >       | sort-order
| -z         | zero length (unary)
| -n         | not zero length (unary)
|===

=== Text Editing (SED)

    # Std In/Out
    sed [options] < original.txt > modified.txt

    # Edit a file in place
    sed [options] -i my_text.txt
    sed [options] -iorig my_text.txt    # saves my_text.orig first

*Command-Line Switches: *

[width="100%"]
|===
| `-E (or -r)`         | use extended regex
| `-e "s/foo/bar/g"`   | specify a command directly
| `-e "s/foo/bar/g;G"` | specify multiple commands directly
| `-f my_script.sed`   | import SED commands from a file
| `-n`                 | don't print (to stdout) any lines unless explicitly printed via the `p` SED command
|===

Tip: repeating the -e and -f switches is allowed.

*The Most Common SED Commands:*

[width="100%"]
|===
| `s/foo/bar/`   | substitute the first occurrence 
| `s/foo/bar/2`  | substitute the Nth occurrence 
| `s/foo/bar/g`  | substitute all occurrences
| `s/foo/bar/3g` | substitute all occurrences starting with the Nth
| `d`            | delete the whole line
| `G`            | insert a blank line after each line
| `p`            | print (to stdout) the line (use the -n switch to suppress printing other lines)
|===

*SED Command Modifiers:*

Any SED command can be preceded by a modifier that restricts the context in which it operates.
Adding a space between the modifier and the command is optional.

[width="100%"]
|===
| `5`              | a particular line
| `5,8`            | a range of lines (5 thru 8)
| `5,+2`           | a range of lines (5 thru 7)
| `5,$`            | all lines from N to the end of the file
| `5~2`            | every-other line starting with line N
| `/foo/`          | all lines that contain the given pattern
| `/start/,/stop/` | a range of lines, starting with the first line that contains the start pattern thru the first line that contains the stop pattern
| `5,/stop/`       | a range of lines, starting with line N thru the first line that contains the stop pattern
|===



[[files]]
== Files

=== File Comparison Operators

[width="100%"]
|===
| -a filename      | file exists; it can be empty or have some content but, so long as it exists, this will be true
| -b filename      | file exists and is a block special file such as a hard drive like /dev/sda or /dev/sda1
| -c filename      | file exists and is a character special file such as a TTY device like /dev/TTY1
| -d filename      | file exists and is a directory
| -e filename      | file exists; this is the same as -a above
| -f filename      | file exists and is a regular file, as opposed to a directory, a device special file, or a link, among others
| -g filename      | file exists and is set-group-id, SETGID
| -h filename      | file exists and is a symbolic link
| -k filename      | file exists and its "sticky'" bit is set
| -p filename      | file exists and is a named pipe (FIFO)
| -r filename      | file exists and is readable, i.e., has its read bit set
| -s filename      | file exists and has a size greater than zero; a file that exists but that has a size of zero will return false
| -t fd            | file descriptor fd is open and refers to a terminal
| -u filename      | file exists and its set-user-id bit is set
| -w filename      | file exists and is writable
| -x filename      | file exists and is executable
| -G filename      | file exists and is owned by the effective group ID
| -L filename      | file exists and is a symbolic link
| -N filename      | file exists and has been modified since it was last read
| -O filename      | file exists and is owned by the effective user ID
| -S filename      | file exists and is a socket
| file1 -ef file2  | file1 and file2 refer to the same device and iNode numbers
| file1 -nt file2  | file1 is newer (according to modification date) than file2, or if file1 exists and file2 does not
| file1 -ot file2  | file1 is older than file2, or if file2 exists and file1 does not
|===

Use ! to invert the logic, e.g. `if [ ! -f filename ]; then...` for if file does not exist.

The `dirname` command strips off the last slash and anything after it (presumably a filename). If the result is empty, it return ".".
${LOG_FILE%/*} 

To get just the file name, use `${fully_qualified_filename##*.[/\\]}`, which greedily deletes from the start to the last slash or backslash



[[dates]]
== Dates

declare IT_IS_NOW=$( date '+<format>' )

Where <format> is...

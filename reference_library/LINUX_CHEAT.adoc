== File System

[width="100%",cols="",options="header"]
|===
| /bin   | user-accessible commands
| /boot  | files needed to boot the system
| /dev   | devices
| /etc   | etcetera -- configuration files, etc.
| /home  | home folders for the non-root user accounts
| /lib   | library files (program modules)
| /media | (automatic) mounting points for filesystem devices (e.g. USB drives)
| /mnt   | (manual) mounting points for filesystem devices (e.g. VM shared folders)
| /root  | home folder for the root account
| /sbin  | root-accessible commands
| /tmp   | temporary files
| /usr   | user-specific
| /var   | log files
|===


== System Operations

=== Kill a process by name

Running `kill` will terminate a process but you have to know the PID (process ID) first. 
`killall` allows you to kill a process but not look up the PID. 
For example: `killall -9 httpd` will kill all the processes that are httpd. 
The -9 basically kills the process with extreme prejudice, it will die immediately. 
Be careful when using this on processes that need to do cleanup before they die.



== Various Server Applications

=== MySQL

`UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=password(‘MyNewPassword') WHERE Host='%' AND User='dbUser'`
`/etc/rc.d/init.d/mysql restart`

=== Apache Web Server

`apt install apache2`
`sudo systemctl start apache2`

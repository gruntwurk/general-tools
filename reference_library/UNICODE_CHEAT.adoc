The "`Short Name`" is a suggested name to use when defining a substitution table. For example, in AsciiDoc, you can define an "`attribute`" such as this:

----
:three-quarters:\&#xBE;
:two-thirds:\&#x2154
----

And then use that attribute by enclosing it in curly braces:

----
Fold in {two-thirds} cup of whipped cream.
----

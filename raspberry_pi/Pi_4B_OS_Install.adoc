= Installing Debian on a Raspberry Pi Model 4B 

NOTE: Raspberry Pi can now boot from USB, if desired.
Newer versions of Model 4B (since April 2020) do this automatically.
Older Pi's need a firmware update.


== Initial Setup

The following steps only need to be performed once, no matter how many Pis you need to (re)configure.

. Alongside these instructions is a folder called `rpi_config` which contains several subfolders and files. 
They are laid out as intended for configuring a Pi 3 or earlier, but we'll cherry-pick some of the files for how we'll configure a Pi 4.

. In your working folder environment, create a project called `rpi4_config`.
Anything you place in this folder will eventually end up in the home folder for the `pi` user.

. Start with copying all of the files that are in `...\general-tools\raspberry_pi\rpi_config\config\files\home\pi` to `rpi4_config`.
(At the time of this writing, it's just `.bashrc` and `.bash_aliases`). 

. Next, copy into `rpi4_config` the `basics_debian.sh` and `helper_functions_debian.sh` scripts from `...\general-tools\scripts_library` -- along with any other desired scripts (e.g. `install_simple_nas_debian.sh` or `install_webserver_debian.sh`).

. Edit each script (except `helper_functions_debian.sh`) to verify/change the various option settings at the top.

. Commit this `C:\work\rpi4_config` project to version control.


== To Actually Configure a Pi

. Download the IMG file (compressed as an XZ file) for the Debian release of your choice from https://raspi.debian.net/tested-images.
FYI: These images include: the bare Debian base install, `raspi3-firmware`, partition management tools (`parted` and `dosfstools`), and network connectivity tools (`wpasupplicant`, `wireless-tools`, and `ssh`).

. Run the Raspberry Pi Imager (or balenaEtcher) to burn the IMG to an SD card or USB stick.
This will create two partitions: a 300MB FAT32 partition for the boot firmware, and a 1GB Linux partition, which Windows won't be able to read. 
NOTE: On the Raspberry, the firmware partition will be mounted under `/boot/firmware`.
Also, the Linux partition will be expanded to use up the full SD card's capacity upon first boot.

. In the boot firmware partition, edit the settings in `config.txt` and/or `cmdline.txt` as desired. 
`config.txt` approximately maps to what you would expect on a PCâ€™s BIOS/UEFI, settings that are applied before Linux is booted.
It includes settings for `root_pw`, `root_authorized_key`, and `hostname`.
At a minimum, set the `root_authorized_key` to your public SSH key.
`cmdline.txt` sets the Linux boot parameters, but you probably won't need to change any of those.

. Copy the `rpi4_config` folder to the boot firmware partition.

. Transfer the SD card to the Pi and boot it up. (You'll need a monitor, mouse, and keyboard.)

. `cd /boot/firmware/rpi4_config` 	
. `chmod 777 *.sh`
. `./basics_debian.sh`
. At the end, `basics_debian.sh` will show you the DHCP-assigned IP address (e.g. 192.168.0.26). Make a note of it.
. Inspect the log: `cat /var/log/basics_debian.sh.log`

. From Windows, SSH in using the created sudo user's credentials e.g. `ssh pi@192.168.0.26` 
You might also want to set up WinSCP to log in the same. 
(You'll need to tell WinSCP where your private key file is and it will want to convert it from OpenSSH format to Putty. Let it.)

. At this point, everything in `/boot/firmware/rpi4_config` will have been copied to the home folder for the created sudo user.
So, if you included any of the other scripts from `general-tools\scripts_library`, you can run them from there.
